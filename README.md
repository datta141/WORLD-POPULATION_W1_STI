# WORLD-POPULATION_W1_STI

This project aims to analyze and visualize population data using Google Sheets and [Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/8a999b8a-716f-4155-9737-bb22e829b4e3). The dataset includes information on the number of males, females, and total population, as well as their locations and age groups. The process involves importing the data into Google Sheets, creating visualizations in Looker Studio like column charts for populations by location, and using row cards to summarize the total, male, and female populations.
